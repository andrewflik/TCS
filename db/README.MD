The database (db.7z) contains data recorded with help of sensors developed for this projecct. These sensors are
- 1 x PIR
- 1 x DHT
- Commands issued through mobile app to control the AC
- External Humidity and Temperature

AS it took some time to develop the sensors, the data got accumulated and is inaccurate for the beginning few weeks. However, the database does contain recorded activity for few months which is enough to train a basic model for inferencing.
